==========

The Hex Atom Controller is an app for the Nexus 7 which is primarily a 	graphical interface designed to 
send commands to the Hex Atom Game.  This app was created to increase the ease with which someone can 
control the Hex Atom Game.  With the Hex Atom Controller there is no need to enter commands and 
all of the functions of the Hex Atom Game are able to be adjusted with greater speed, and with less of 
a need to be concentrating on the commands.  This app is designed such that the users attention can remain 
on the Hex Atom Game and the controller is intuitive enough to not require much attention.
